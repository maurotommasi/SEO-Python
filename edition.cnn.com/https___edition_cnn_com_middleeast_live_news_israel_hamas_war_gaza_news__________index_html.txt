"So I hope you can understand that we're not really going to be able to talk much about motivations and the details here. We're just glad that they're safe and sound and hopefully home soon."He said the US is not “interfering” in Israel’s military operations, but did reiterate that the issue of hostages was “front and center on the president’s mind when he met with the Prime Minister (Netanyahu) and he had the chance to meet with some of the families.”On the humanitarian corridor atRafah crossing, Kirby said it will be open “very, very soon.”US President Joe Biden is confident the humanitarian assistance would flow into Gaza "in the coming hours, if not a couple of days," Kirby added.The road leading to the crossing has suffered damage, preventing the trucks from being able to "traverse that road safely and efficiently," he said, adding, "...the Egyptians are working on repairs to that road."Kirby also defended the administration’s efforts to protect innocent people in Gaza, saying that collateral damage has been a key concern of the Biden administration.“We're going to do everything we can to not only get the gate open and get that stuff in but put in place a sustainable method for it to keep going," Kirby said, adding Biden "has been laser-focused on this from very, very early on."share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link22 min agoHamas releases 2 American hostages.

It was launched by Israel in retaliation foran October 7 attackon the country by Gaza’s Hamas rulers — Israeli authorities say 1,400 people were killed and around 200 were takenhostage.In a sign of the growing anger over the Israeli operation in Gaza, Egypt sanctioned its first major nationwide protest in a decade. Hundreds of protesters gathered Friday near downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square in support of Palestinians, and demonstrations occurred in other Egyptian cities.Some of the Cairo protesters chanted, “Where is the Arab army?” and, “Here they are, the Zionists,” referring to Egypt’s riot police, who pushed demonstrators into nearby Bab el-Louk Square and closed access to Tahrir.In the Lebanese capital, Beirut, several hundred people took to the streets to denounce the Israeli offensive. Many waved the Palestinian and Lebanese flags, along with the flags of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and its political ally in Lebanon, Amal. Young protesters burned the American flag, decrying Washington’s support for Israel.Hundreds of Iraqis, mostly supporters of Iran-backed militias, staged a sit-in Friday at Iraq’s main border crossing with Jordan. Others protested in Baghdad, not far from the fortified Green Zone that houses the United States embassy.In Jordan’s capital, Amman, some 6,000 protesters marched in support of Gazans. Some chanted slogans urging Hamas to intensify its strikes on Israel, Reuters reported.The protests signal growing anger on the Arab street and frustration among regional leaders with the war as the Palestinian death toll climbs, and with the US’ perceived unwillingness to put restraints on Israel’s actions.Rhetoric against Israel has been particularly heated from the governments of Jordan and Egypt, two US-allied countries that border the Jewish state and were the first Arab nations to sign peace treaties with it. Amman and Cairo have sounded alarms over what they perceive as a plan to transfer Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank to Egypt and Jordan. While Israel has not announced any such plans, both countries have warned such a move could pull them into war.Read more about protests across the Middle East.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 1 min agoProtesters in Yemen march in support of PalestiniansFrom CNN's Ruba AlhenawiProtesters march Friday in Sanaa, Yemen, to condemn Israel’s offensive in Gaza.

And again, it's what distinguishes us, distinguishes Israel, from terrorist groups like Hamas, which not only have absolutely no concern for innocent human life, they intentionally use innocent human lives to hide behind, to use as quite literally as human shields, knowing that civilians invariably are going to suffer in conflict,” Blinken said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link25 min agoGaza hospital says it faces imminent threat of airstrike from Israeli armyFrom Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman and Hamdi AlkhshaliThe administration of Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza says the Israeli army has contacted them demanding the immediate evacuation of the hospital in preparation for a nighttime airstrike.The Palestinian Red Crescent also issued an urgent appeal saying it has “received a threat from the occupying authorities to bombard Al-Quds Hospital and has demanded the hospital's immediate evacuation.”Al-Quds Hospital currently houses over 400 patients and approximately 12,000 displaced civilians who have sought refuge there as a safe haven, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.The Israel Defense Forces said it requested residents in the northern area of the Gaza Strip to evacuate "in order to mitigate civilian harm.""Hamas intentionally embeds its assets in civilian areas and uses the residents of the Gaza Strip as human shields," the IDF statement said.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society urged the international community to take immediate action to prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe similar to the tragic incident atAl-Ahli Baptist Hospital, which was bombed Tuesday.In a statement Friday, Gaza’s Head of the Government Media Office Salamah Marouf said "medical teams have made their decision not to respond to the occupation's threat and not to comply with evacuation warnings. They prioritize their humanitarian role and professional duties, remaining in their positions and continuing to provide services to patients and the wounded, as well as assisting the displaced."Dr. Mai Alkaila, head of the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, issued a statement on Friday appealing to the "international community and all international human rights organizations to intervene and protect the Al Quds Hospital in Gaza from the threat of bombardment by the Israeli occupation authorities."The World Health Organization (WHO) expressed concern following the evacuation orders."Worrying reports of evacuation orders sent to Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza," WHO said in astatementon Friday. "The sanctity of health care must be respected at all times."The WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus furtherstressedthat "it is impossible for these overcrowded hospitals to safely evacuate patients."CNN's Kareem El Damanhoury contributed reporting.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 26 min agoUS expects Rafah border crossing to open for humanitarian aid soonFrom Jennifer HanslerA convoy of trucks carrying aid supplies line up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing on October 20.
