The theory is based on the logic that excessive fear tends to drive down share prices, and too much greed tends to have the opposite effect.How is Fear & Greed Calculated?The Fear & Greed Index is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behavior. They are market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand. The index tracks how much these individual indicators deviate from their averages compared to how much they normally diverge. The index gives each indicator equal weighting in calculating a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing maximum greediness and 0 signaling maximum fear.How often is the Fear & Greed Index calculated?Every component and the Index are calculated as soon as new data becomes available.How to use Fear & Greed Index?The Fear & Greed Index is used to gauge the mood of the market. Many investors are emotional and reactionary, and fear and greed sentiment indicators can alert investors to their own emotions and biases that can influence their decisions. When combined with fundamentals and other analytical tools, the Index can be a helpful way to assess market sentiment.Return to Fear & Greed IndexRelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackQuote LookupAd FeedbackLatest Markets NewsCraig Barritt/Getty Images for CasamigosGoldman Sachs CEO stops doing controversial DJ gigsAhmad Hasaballah/Getty ImagesWhat the Israel-Hamas war means for US marketsAbir Sultan/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockOil prices fluctuate as concerns mount over Middle East tensionsKevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesSocial Security gains came back to earth.
